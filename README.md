## Repository for the 4th homework.

## Group #28 composed by:

## Content of the repository:
- homework4_main.ipynb : main notebook with every output
- utility_functions.py : .py file with every function used in the first part of the homework
- all_peaks.csv: file in which we save the set of all the peaks' songs
- dataSignature.csv: file in which we save the whole signature matrix created from the dataset
- matrix.pkl, peaks.pkl, signature.pkl: these files contain the shingles matrix, the list of all the peaks and the signatures. We saved them to resume our work without having to recreate them each time.
